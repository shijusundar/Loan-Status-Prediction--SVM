# Loan-Status-Prediction--SVM
This project aims to predict the loan status of applicants using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify loan applicants into two categories: approved (1) or not approved (0) based on various features such as gender, marital status, education level, employment status, and property area.
